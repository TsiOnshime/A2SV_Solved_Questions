# [Knapsack with Duplicate Items](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/knapsack-with-duplicate-items4201/1)
## Medium
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array wt[] and&nbsp;val[] respectively. Also, a knapsack with a weight limit capacity.Your task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit.
Note: Each item can be taken any number of times.
Examples:
Input: val[] = [1, 1], wt[] = [2, 1], capacity = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The optimal choice is to pick the 2nd element 3 times.

Input: val[] = [10, 40, 50, 70], wt[] = [1, 3, 4, 5], capacity = 8
Output: 110
Explanation: The optimal choice is to pick the 2nd element and the 4th element.
Input: val[] = [6, 8, 7, 100], wt[] = [2, 3, 4, 5], capacity = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't pick any element. Hence, total profit is 0.
Constraints:1 ≤ val.size() = wt.size() ≤ 10001 ≤ capacity ≤ 10001 ≤ val[i], wt[i] ≤ 100
